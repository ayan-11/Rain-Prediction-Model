# Rain Prediction System (Australia Dataset)

## Introduction

This repository contains a Rain Prediction System built with Machine Learning using a dataset from Australia. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately predict whether it will rain in a particular location in Australia based on historical weather data. This system can be a valuable tool for farmers, meteorologists, and anyone interested in monitoring and predicting rainfall in Australia.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Rain in Australia" dataset, which provides daily weather data collected from various weather stations across Australia. The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, and it contains labels indicating whether it rained on that day.

**Dataset Source:** [Rain in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

## Requirements

To run the Rain Prediction System, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and experimenting with the provided notebooks)

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayan-11/Rain-Prediction-Model.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Rain-Prediction-Model
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file `Rain_Prediction_System.ipynb` to explore the code, data analysis, and model building.

5. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to build and evaluate the rain prediction model.

## Model Building

The project involves the following main steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming data as needed.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data to gain insights into weather patterns in Australia.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for machine learning.
4. Model Selection: Choosing and training machine learning models.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance and selecting the best model.

## Results

The Rain Prediction System provides an accurate model for predicting whether it will rain on a given day in Australia. The model's performance is assessed based on various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
